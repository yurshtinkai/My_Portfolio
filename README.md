## About This Project

This portfolio serves as my digital resume and a central hub for my work. It's designed to be clean, modern, and interactive, providing a seamless user experience for anyone interested in learning more about me and my technical abilities. The entire site is built from scratch to reflect my skills in front-end development and design.

## ✨ Key Features

Based on the code, this portfolio includes several dynamic features:

* **🎨 Dark & Light Mode:** A seamless theme-switcher that respects user's system preference (`prefers-color-scheme`) and saves their choice in `localStorage`.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** The UI adapts beautifully to all screen sizes, from a small mobile phone to a large desktop monitor, featuring a custom mobile sidebar menu.
* **🚀 Dynamic Animations:**
    * **Scroll Reveal:** Sections and elements gracefully fade in and slide up as you scroll, powered by the `IntersectionObserver` API.
    * **Typewriter Effect:** The hero section features an animated typewriter effect to introduce my passion for coding.
    * **Project Carousel:** Each project card features an auto-sliding image carousel to showcase multiple facets of the work.
* **🧭 Active Navigation:** The navigation bar automatically highlights the link corresponding to the section of the page you are currently viewing.
* **💅 Modern UI/UX:**
    * **Glassmorphism:** Project cards use a "glass" effect (`backdrop-filter`) for a modern, sleek look.
    * **Animated Gradients:** The background features a subtle, looping animated gradient.
    * **Custom Hovers:** Includes custom tooltips and hover effects on all interactive elements.
