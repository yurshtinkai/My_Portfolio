Lourd Angelou D. Bufete - Personal Portfolio Website
This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and journey as a BSIT student and aspiring web developer.

React (non‑Vite) setup added

Run locally:

1. Install Node.js 18+.
2. In this folder run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Your existing `style.css`, images, and content have been migrated into React components (`src/App.jsx`). Tailwind is loaded via CDN in `public/index.html` for simplicity.

🚀 Features
Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout that looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Smooth Scrolling: Seamless navigation between sections.

Dynamic UI Elements:

A header that becomes opaque and adds a shadow on scroll.

An engaging typewriter effect in the hero section.

Subtle scroll-reveal animations for a modern feel.

Interactive Sections: Includes sections for Home, About Me, Skills, Featured Projects, and a Contact Form.

Clean Code: Well-structured and commented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
